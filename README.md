# Java Projects: J-Spider Software Training Institute
This repository contains a collection of Java programming projects created during my training at the **J-Spider Software Training Institute (Noida Branch)**. These projects were developed by **Ankush Raj**, also known as **Ankush Raj Mahe Yam**, as part of the learning process.  

Each project focuses on specific aspects of Java, including but not limited to:  
- **Method Implementation**  
- **Conditional Logic**  
- **Loops (While, For, Do-While)**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Problem-Solving Techniques**

## Repository Structure

Each Projectment is stored in a separate folder named according to the Projectment number (e.g., `Project1`, `Project2`, etc.). Inside each folder, you will find Java code files that solve specific problems given in the Projects.

### Folder Structure

```
Java-Projectment_J-Spider/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Project1/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ShoppingCart.java
    â”œâ”€â”€ Project2/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ElectricityChargeCalculation.java
    â””â”€â”€ (Future Projects will be added in separate folders)
```

### Example Folders

### Folder: Project1

The **Project1** folder contains the following Java problems:
### Write a Java program to implement a **Shopping Cart System**. The program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of items they wish to purchase.
2. Allow the user to input the price of each item one by one.
3. Calculate the total price of all the items.
4. Apply a discount based on the total price using the following criteria:
   - **40% discount** if the total is â‰¥10,000.
   - **30% discount** if the total is â‰¥7,000 but less than 10,000.
   - **20% discount** if the total is â‰¥3,000 but less than 7,000.
   - **8% discount** for totals less than 3,000.
5. Display:
   - The total price before the discount.
   - The discount percentage applied.
   - The final amount to be paid after the discount.
6. End with a "Thank you for shopping" message.


### Folder: Project2
The **Project1** folder contains the following Java problems:
### Write a Java program to calculate the **electricity bill** based on the user's unit consumption. The program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter:
   - The **old unit reading**.
   - The **current unit reading**.
2. Validate that the **current unit reading** is greater than the **old unit reading**:
   - If invalid, display an error message and terminate the program.
3. Calculate the **total unit consumption** as:
   - `totalUnitConsumed = currentUnit - oldUnit`.
4. Calculate the electricity cost based on the following tariff:
   - **First 50 units**: â‚¹1.25 per unit.
   - **Next 20 units** (51 to 70): â‚¹1.75 per unit.
   - **Next 30 units** (71 to 100): â‚¹2.25 per unit.
   - **Beyond 100 units**: â‚¹3.00 per unit.
5. Add a **20% surcharge** to the calculated cost.
6. Display the total consumption and the final bill amount.

### Future Projects

Future Projects will follow the same structure and will be placed in their respective folders as they are added, for example:

- **Project3/** (Coming soon)
- **Project4/** (Coming soon)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkushRajMaheYam/Java-Projectment_J-Spider.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific Projectment folder (e.g., Project1):
   ```bash
   cd Java-Projectment_J-Spider/Project1
   ```

3. Compile and run the Java programs:
   ```bash
   javac Project1.java
   java Project1
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary values and test the methods.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** You can use any Java-supported IDE such as VScode, IntelliJ, Eclipse, or the command line to compile and run the programs.
