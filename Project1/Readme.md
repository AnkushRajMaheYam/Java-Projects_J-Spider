### **Shopping Cart Project**

Write a Java program to implement a **Shopping Cart System**. The program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of items they wish to purchase.
2. Allow the user to input the price of each item one by one.
3. Calculate the total price of all the items.
4. Apply a discount based on the total price using the following criteria:
   - **40% discount** if the total is \( \geq 10,000 \).
   - **30% discount** if the total is \( \geq 7,000 \) but less than \( 10,000 \).
   - **20% discount** if the total is \( \geq 3,000 \) but less than \( 7,000 \).
   - **8% discount** for totals less than \( 3,000 \).
5. Display:
   - The total price before the discount.
   - The discount percentage applied.
   - The final amount to be paid after the discount.
6. End with a "Thank you for shopping" message.
